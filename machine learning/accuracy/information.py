#Term	                                Easy Explanation
#Feature(Input/Independent Variable)	The input values we give to the model (example: area of a house, number of rooms).
#Target(Output/Dependent Variable)	    The value we want the model to predict (example: price of the house).
#Model	                                A formula or system that predicts the output based on inputs (example: y = mx + c).
#Coefficient (m)	                    The weight assigned to the input feature. It shows how much the input affects the output.
#Intercept (c)	                        The value of output when the input is zero. It’s where the line crosses the Y-axis.
#Prediction	                            The model’s guessed output when new input values are given.
#Cost Function (Loss Function)	        A formula that calculates how wrong the model's predictions are. We aim to minimize this value.
#Mean Squared Error (MSE)	            The average of the squared differences between actual and predicted outputs. (Common cost function for Linear Regression.)
#Gradient Descent	                    A method the model uses to automatically adjust itself to find the best coefficients (best-fit line).
#Overfitting	                        When the model learns the training data too well but performs badly on new data.
#Underfitting	                        When the model is too simple and does not even perform well on the training data.


#Term	                    simplier Meaning
#Feature (Input)	        The information we give to the model (like house size).
#Target (Output)	        What we want the model to guess (like house price).
#Model	                    A formula that makes guesses based on the input.
#Coefficient (m)	        A number that shows how important an input is.
#Intercept (c)	            The model's guess when input is zero.
#Prediction	                The model's guess for new input.
#Cost Function	            How wrong the model's guesses are.
#Mean Squared Error (MSE)	The average of how much the guesses are off, squared.
#Gradient Descent	        A way for the model to fix itself to guess better.
#Overfitting	            Model is too good on old data but bad on new data.
#Underfitting	            Model is too simple and bad on all data.
